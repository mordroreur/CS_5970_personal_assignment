# Medieval VR Personal Project

## Overview
This project is a **VR experience scene in Unity** using the **XR Interaction Toolkit**.  
It takes place in a **medieval tavern environment**, allowing the player to:
- Move around using teleportation or walking.  
- Interact with objects such as cupboard doors, plates, books, or hat.  
- Experience dynamic lighting, particle effects (fire, smoke), and baked shadows for realism.  

The goal is to demonstrate interactive physics-based mechanics in a VR medieval scene.
